# About the project:
· An Modern Website made with TailwindCSS, Vite module manager and React.js. Totally responsive. <br />
· Made this as my first project with tailwind and react working together. <br />
· Made cool gradients and choosed beautiful colors to pass the feelling of an modern website.

# Observations
· Guess that the HTML syntax could be better, but... whatever. <br />
· Tried to apply many concepts to make it a little bit easier to write. <br />
· I don't usually write code with mocks data but for this project it was necessary. Good for praticing too.
